    /*   An enumeration of supported Elvin security schemes. A key scheme
    * defines a mode of sending or receiving notifications securely.
    * 
    * <h3>The Producer Scheme</h3>
    * 
    * In the producer scheme, consumers of notifications ensure that a
    * notification producer is known to them. The producer uses the
    * private key, and consumers use the public key. If the producer
    * keeps its private key secure, consumers can be assured they are
    * receiving notifications from a trusted producer.
    * 
    * <h3>The Consumer Scheme</h3>
    * 
    * In the consumer scheme, producers of notifications ensure that a
    * notification consumer is known to them, i.e. the producer controls
    * who can receive its notifications. In this scheme -- the reverse of
    * the producer scheme -- the consumer uses the private key, and
    * producers use the public key. If the consumer keeps its private key
    * secure, then the producer can be assured that only the trusted
    * consumer can receive its notifications.
    * 
    * <h3>The Dual Scheme</h3>
    * 
    * The dual scheme combines both the producer and consumer schemes, so
    * that both ends can send and receive securely. Typically both ends
    * exchange public keys, and each end then emits notifications with
    * both its private key and the public key(s) of its intended
    * consumer(s) attached. Similarly, each end would subscribe using its
    * private key and the public key(s) of its intended producer(s).
    * 
    * <h3>Avis Key Scheme API</h3>
    * 
    * The Elvin Producer and Consumer schemes both use a single set of
    * keys, whereas the Dual scheme requires both a consumer key set and
    * a producer key set. The schemes that require a single set of keys
    * are defined by an instance of {@link SingleKeyScheme}, the Dual
    * scheme is defined by an instance of {@link DualKeyScheme}.
    * <p>
    * Each key scheme also defines a {@link #keyHash secure hash} for
    * generating its public keys: see the documentation on
    * {@linkplain Key security keys} for more information on public and
    * private keys used in key schemes.
    * 
    * <h3>Supported Schemes</h3>
    * 
    * Avis currently supports just the SHA-1 secure hash as defined in
    * version 4.0 of the Elvin protocol. As such, three schemes are
    * available: {@link #SHA1_CONSUMER SHA1-Consumer},
    * {@link #SHA1_PRODUCER SHA1-Producer} and
    * {@link #SHA1_DUAL SHA1-Dual}.*/
